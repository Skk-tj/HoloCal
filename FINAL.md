# Update

HoloCal will no longer be available on the App Store after March 24, 2024. Development of this app will also stop after March 24, 2024.

## Will this app stop working?

No. As long as you have it on your device, it shouldn't stop working. 

## Why?

1. Apple charges me US$99 a year to publish this app.
2. I had some ideas to improve this app. Like adding interesting data to each Vtuber. Unfortunately I cannot find any accessible data API to support this feature.
3. General lack of motivation.

## Anything else?

This app is open-source. If you want to publish this app yourself, you are free to do so. 

You can also build this app yourself and install it on your phone. You'll need a Mac and Xcode to do that.
