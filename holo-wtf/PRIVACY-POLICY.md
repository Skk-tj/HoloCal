## Information Collection and Use

This App collects no personally-identifiable information from users. 

## Log Data

This App does not intentionally log and transmit personally-identifiable data. However, as this App is distributed via Apple's platforms, such as the App Store, Apple may choose to log data related to the App's fatal crash. The logged data may contain personally-identifiable information. Please consult with Apple if you have any concern regarding this. 

This App also uses Sentry (sentry.io) to track basic diagnostics. No personally-identifiable information is transmitted.

If you elect to join the beta testing of this App and choose to leave feedback, there may be personally-identifiable information visible to me, but the information is never shared.

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.
